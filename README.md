# Custom 6502 Emulator for the Web

A almost identical source port of my [Hacker Maker Library MOS 6502 Components](https://github.com/kveroneau/klib/tree/main/HMLib) to Pas2JS, allowing 6502 programs using this kit to be easily shared between a desktop application, and a web-based application.

## Why would you want this?

These classes included in this package allow for the creation of custom 6502 systems, either based on real life systems, or entirely custom systems.  It can be used to create interactive websites which run 6502 machine code, allowing the ability to demonstrate 6502 programming, or for other purposes.
