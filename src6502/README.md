## 6502 Source Code

All of the source code located within these directories are for the 6502, as the compiled binaries are fairly small for this processor, I will also provide compiled binaries within the repository itself.  I know it is not best practice to store binary files in a repository, but as these binaries are extremely small, I doubt it will have much of a performance impact on the git, and it is much more convenient for people who just want to get started with various examples.
